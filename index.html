			</div>

		<div id="explanation">
			<p>The premise is simple: for each Smash game, choose six Smashers who you think will perform well. Only those who place in the top 64 of their respective game will earn points. And the better a Smasher whom you chose places, the more points you earn!</p>

			<p>But there's a catch! As more and more people choose a Smasher, the less points each person can potentially earn from that Smasher placing well. You might consider taking a risk and pick a less-popular Smasher: instead of betting on <a title="Z I P B O Y S">Leffen</a>, <a title="The secret is in the scarf.">Zero</a>, or <a title="aka The Swedish Sniper">Armada</a>, you could consider picking <a title="my b">Chillin</a>, <a title="Entered as TH | trintroll">Bill Trinen</a>, or <a title="EZ $">Bizzarro Flame</a>. As long as they place in the top 64, then they could potentially earn more points for you than more-popular Smashers.</p>

			<p>This works similar to how real-life markets work. You can reap a lot more profit by investing in small companies than in big ones, but you also take on a lot more risk. Extending the analogy, you can earn more points by picking an underrated Smasher, but you could walk away with nothing if that Smasher doesn't place in the top 64.</p>

			<p>Therefore, there's no single best strategy for playing this game. You could bet conservatively and stick to the big names, you could go all-out YOLO and bet on the underdogs, or you could employ a mix of both strategies. Regardless, you should check back regularly as a Smasher's popularity may fluctuate frequently.</p>
